<p>Every Sunday a group of volunteers, ranging from doctors and social workers to teenagers and medical students, work together to run the Raphael Clinic, a hospital offering free medical services to foreign workers. The Raphael Clinic serves immigrants from all over the world. Located in the Hyehwa-dong area of Seoul, South Korea, on Sundays a lively community of Filipinos convene in this neighborhood to attend the Catholic Church, buy goods at the street side market, andÂ get a checkup at the clinic in a weekly ritual that brings with it a dose of cultural diversity. <a title="Read: A Place to Call Their Own" href="http://www.internationalunderground.org/korea/filipino/place-call-their-own">Read the corresponding article</a>.<br />
