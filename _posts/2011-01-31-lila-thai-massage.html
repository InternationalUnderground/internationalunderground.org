<p>Away from the adventure tourism shops and restarurants of Chiang Mai, Thailand is a large block surrounded by high white walls. One side is covered in murals of animals and plants. A second wall, six feet high, of flowering lillies stands in front of the strong, certain white wall. There are two statues of a woman kneeling and pouring water from a jug. The one on the left is chipped, faded and discolored. The wear makes the woman look dispropitional with impossibly thin arms and disfigured shoulders. The woman on the right is old and worn, but not striking in her uglyness. Between them is a great steel door with a smaller door cut out of it. Above the door in Thai and English it says "Chiang Mai Women's Prison. No pictures."</p>
<p>For three years, Pom, 36, lived "inside" as she refers to it. Pom is a slender Thai woman with waxed eyebrows and long, dark hair. She was seperated from her two sons, now 17 and 12, because she was caught with illegal meth amphetamines, which she says is a common offense for women. She stayed in one prison where 70 to 100 women lived in one large room. She said that seperation was the worst part of being in prison.</p>
<p>"You can not come and hold your family," she said.</p>
<p>In Thailand, when women like Pom get out of prison they often find it difficult to find a job. Even if they get a job that doesn't require a background check they can be fired later if their boss finds out they were once in prison. But for Pom it was different.</p>
<p>"When I came out it was not hard cause I knew boss here," she said.</p>
<p>Here is the Lila Thai Massage Center. Now Pom wears a modest wrap around purple skirt and shirt for her uniform as a Lila Thai masseuse. The center, founded in 2007, is an outlet for a vocational training program set up inside the Chiang Mai Women's Prison. Naowarat Thanasrisutharat is the founder of Lila Thai and also worked in the Thai correctional system for 40 years, including eight years as the director of the Chiang Mai Women's Prison. Lila Thai now has two locations in Chiang Mai. The first opened three years ago and the new facility is only seven months old. Together the two facilites employ 20 former inmates as massues. To become a massuse, the women must complete a four-month, 180-hour course and then pass a Chiang Mai Public Health test.</p>
<p>Pom heard about the program after being in prison for about a year. Her friend encouraged her to take the training, but Pom was reluctant.</p>
<p>"I no like to learn massage before. After I go out I have to work," she said.</p>
<p>While inside, Pom was able to read magazines and many had advertisements for massues jobs. She figured she could make good money when she was released. Once she started taking the classes and practicing with her friends, she found it easy to learn.</p>
<p>The training is offered three times per year and each time about 30 people complete it, according to Nanthawan, Nawarat's daughter and a manager at Lila Thai. More than half of those who begin the training pass the final exam. Nanthawan said it's difficult for women who are released from prison.</p>
<p>"Thai people don't accept them. Don't give them work," she said.</p>
<p>Some women find jobs cleaning in hotels, but they are always worried about being fired because of their past.</p>
<p>"If they don't have any place to go, they will come here," she said.</p>
<p>As massues, the women earn 100 baht per hour for multi-hour treatments and half of what the customer pays for one hour Thai-style massages. A basic Thai foot massage costs 150 baht for one hour while a special package lasting nearly three hours costs 1100 baht. During the low season of August, September, and October the women are paid a minimum wage even if they have no customers. Nanthawan says the massues at Lila Thai are paid a similar wage as other massues in the area. According to a 2008 Bangkok Post article, one masseuse said she earned between 17,000 and 18,000 baht a month. </p>
<p>Pom has worked at Lila Thai for four months. She lives with her family and uses the money she makes to support her two sons. Though all the women come from Chiang Mai Women's Prison, some of their families live in Bangkok or southern Thailand. According to Nanthawan, about 60 percent of the massues are from the north with a third from Chiang Mai. Most of the women have children, but if their family lives in the south it can be hard to see them. During the low season some women take long vacations to visit their families then return to Lila Thai with the tourists.</p>
<p>The two Lila Thai centers grew out of a smaller massage business set up just across the street from the flower wall outside the Chiang Mai Women's Prison. That shop was also started by Naowarat, but was later expanded to a private business in the center of Chiang Mai. </p>
<p>The older of the two Lila Thai centers is on a busy business street in central Chiang Mai, just south of the Three Kings Monument. Outside a small fountain bubbles, and the masseuses sit on dark wooden benches, waiting for clients to stroll by. They pass the time talking to each other about their families or by chatting with the owner of a clothing shop next door. Pom said it's easy for her to talk to other masseuses because they have all been through some of the same difficult experiences. </p>
<p>"We know about each other's life. We know what life is like," she said. </p>
<p>Inside the ceiling is high and the lights are turned down low. There is a row of black recliners and short stools for foot massages. Behind a partition are a row of large mats for hot oil massages and body scrubs. The air smells of scented candles and limes. </p>
<p>Pom is happy with her job, has made easy friends with her coworkers, and, most importantly, she gets to live with her family.  </p>
