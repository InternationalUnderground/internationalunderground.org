<p>A walk around the Hyehwa Filipino Market garners many sights and sounds. Filipinos amble about before and after church talking loudly to vendors and friends. Korean, Tagalog, and English waft through the air while vendors push their products. A handful of American expats are usually on hand to sample the delicious Filipino foods being sizzled up on the grills and woks and to buy imported goods that are hard to find anywhere else. But why take our word for it? Listen and see for yourself just what the Hyehwa Filipino Market is really all about.<br />
