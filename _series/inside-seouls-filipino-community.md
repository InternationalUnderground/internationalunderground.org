Korea is home to 50,000 Filipinos who often face long hours and adversity. Each Sunday Filipinos come together in Seoul to run a market, attend mass, get medical care, and enjoy a taste of home. Now the market, a unifying element of this determined community, faces closure.

Usually Hyehwa-dong is known for its cafes and theaters. On Sundays, a slice of this area is transformed into a supportive community for Filipinos and the bustling streetside market is just the beginning. Nearby, Filipinos take communion at the Hyehwa Catholic Church, send money home to loved ones at a bank opened just for them, and wait in a high school hallway for free medical care from the Raphael Clinic. Convening with fellow compatriots for a welcome taste of home is a weekly ritual for many Filipinos.

Now, the city is on the verge of shutting down the Filipino Market and removing a vital part of the supportive network Filipinos have created in Hyewha. Beneath the surface of this spirited community lies the untold stories of migrant laborers and separated families. In this project we shed light on their lives."
