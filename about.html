<p>International Underground is a place for stories from around the  world, giving a voice to people whose experiences often go untold. From  manual laborers to food vendors, farmers to migrant workers, and the  many faces in between, we strive to cover the hardships and triumphs of  the under-reported. Our multimedia stories offer readers a deeper  understanding of people who lead quiet, hard-working lives in all  corners of the globe.</p>
<p>We also want to be a place for  expats, freelance writers, photographers and multimedia artists to  gather their skills together to tell vivid and moving stories in all  shapes and mediums. No matter where you are, we'd love to help you get  your story out to the world. Linking people and cultures together the  world over with video, text, photos, audio, and any other manner of  storytelling, we want to encourage more thoughtful coverage of people  who otherwise are invisible in society. We hope you find the untold  stories of the world are sometimes the most important ones to tell.</p>
